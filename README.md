# Teaching Plan â†’ iOS Calendar

- `TeachingPlan_Parse_and_Select.ipynb`: Repo-friendly notebook that reads a DOCX, lists all detected CourseCode+Class combos, lets you edit desired codes, and writes an `.ics` to output.

Quick start:
1. Place your teaching plan `.docx` in `data/` (create if missing).
2. Open `TeachingPlan_Parse_and_Select.ipynb` and run cells; edit `DESIRED_CODES` to choose courses (e.g., `ECON6001D`).
3. The generated calendar will be saved under `output/`.

Dependencies are installed from within the notebooks when first run (`python-docx`, `icalendar`)
